# Greedy

* How do you identify a greedy problem?
    * Usually, going to min-max something (just like DP), but
      there is an "obvious" way to do it.

* Proof of correctness ??
* Sometimes, transforming the input enables a greedy approach (like sorting).
* Lambdas can be useful to write concise, tailor-made heuristics. Harder to understand?
