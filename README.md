# Weekly 87

* Card grouping and backspace were easy.
* Missed the edge case where a mountain reduces to a slope on first submit
* Did not solve the hard problem.
    * could have been dp?
    * could have been adj. list -> adj. matrix and exponentiate? 
    * Hamiltonian path/TSP ? but edge lengths are equal so way easier probably.

# Notes

* Initialize the vectors/containers using the default constructors provided (don't resize() for that)
* When the problem is simple just simulating a human approach works (cards)
* Test the edge cases properly instead of assuming they'll work.
