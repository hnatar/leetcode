# Weekly 87

* Card grouping and backspace were easy.
* Missed the edge case where a mountain reduces to a slope on first submit
* Did not solve the hard problem.
    * could have been dp?
    * could have been adj. list -> adj. matrix and exponentiate? 
    * Hamiltonian path/TSP ? but edge lengths are equal so way easier probably.
